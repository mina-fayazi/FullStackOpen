# Part 1 - Full Stack Open

This directory contains the exercises for Part 1 of the FullStackOpen course.

## Exercises

### 1.1: Course Information, step 1
- Refactor the app to use separate components (Header, Content, and Total).

### 1.2: Course Information, step 2
- Refactor the Content component to render three Part components of which each renders the name and number of exercises of one part.

### 1.3: Course Information, step 3
- Refactor the code to use objects for each part containing the name and the number of exercises.

### 1.4: Course Information, step 4
- Place the parts into an array of objects and pass them as props to the components.

### 1.5: Course Information, step 5
- Combine the course and parts into a single object and refactor the components accordingly.

### 1.6: Unicafe, step 1
- Implement a feedback collection app for Unicafe. The app tracks three types of feedback (good, neutral, bad) and displays the count for each.

### 1.7: Unicafe, step 2
- Add additional statistics to the Unicafe feedback app. Display the total feedback count, average score, and positive feedback percentage.

### 1.8: Unicafe, step 3
- Extract the statistics into a separate `Statistics` component.

### 1.9: Unicafe, step 4
- Display `No feedback given` when no feedback has been gathered, otherwise show feedback statistics.

### 1.10: Unicafe, step 5
- Refactor the application by creating two new components:
  - `Button`: Handles the functionality of each feedback button.
  - `StatisticLine`: Displays a single line of a statistic (e.g., good, neutral, total).

### 1.11\*: Unicafe, step 6
- Display the statistics in an HTML table layout.

### 1.12\*: Anecdotes, step 1
- Add a button to display a random software engineering anecdote from an array of quotes.

### 1.13\*: Anecdotes, step 2
- Add functionality to vote for the displayed anecdote. Each anecdote has an individual vote count stored in an array.
